# Project Summary

This project is designed to give you an opportunity to build something from scratch and to teach you how to build a react application. The instructions give you a rough idea of what order to do things in, but there won't be any guidance or solutions on how to write the code itself.

### Setup

Start by running `create-react-app .` in the root of this project, this will create a new react application without creating a new directory.

Select one of the following apps to clone, or get mentor approval for your own idea. All ideas must meet a minimum requirement of using an event handler, a child component that receives a function from its parent, invokes the function, and updates parent state.

[Name is in list](https://wom58kwjp5.codesandbox.io/) </br>
[Awful Calculator](https://2oo6nj0z4j.codesandbox.io/) </br>
[Todo List](https://ko3lk6rp87.codesandbox.io/) </br>

### Requirements

1. [Setup state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) in App.js
1. Create and import a child component
1. [Render Child Component,](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) passing any props it will need to work. Remember, if you pass a function down, you'll want to bind it in the parent component.
1. Inside child component invoke a passed in function using an [event handler.](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) (A good example of this would be onClick/onChange)

### Complete

Once you have completed all of these tasks, show your work to your mentor for approval then push to github.
